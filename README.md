# LSTM for Network Intrusion Detection

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify network traffic into four categories: Non-Tor, NonVPN, Tor, and VPN. The model is built with Python using TensorFlow/Keras and achieves a high level of accuracy in identifying different types of network flows.

## üéØ Goal

The primary goal is to build an effective intrusion detection system that can distinguish between benign and anonymized (Tor, VPN) network traffic based on flow characteristics.

##  workflow-chart How It Works

The entire process is contained within the `Intrusion_detection_LSTM.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
    * The model loads the `darknet.csv` dataset.
    * Irrelevant columns (like `Flow ID`, `Src IP`) are dropped.
    * The data is cleaned by handling infinite values and dropping rows with missing data.

2.  **Preprocessing and Feature Scaling:**
    * Categorical labels (`Label` column) are converted into numerical format using `LabelEncoder`.
    * All numerical features are standardized using `StandardScaler`. This is a crucial step that ensures all features contribute equally to the model's performance.
    * The target labels are one-hot encoded to prepare them for multi-class classification.

3.  **Model Architecture:**
    * A `Sequential` model is built using TensorFlow/Keras.
    * The core of the model is a single **LSTM layer** with 50 units. Although the data is tabular, each row is treated as a sequence with a single timestep.
    * The final output layer is a `Dense` layer with `softmax` activation, which outputs the probability for each of the four traffic classes.

4.  **Training and Evaluation:**
    * The model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss function.
    * **Early Stopping** is used during training to prevent overfitting and save the best version of the model.
    * The model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20% (the test set).

## üìä Results

The model performs exceptionally well on the test data.

* **Final Test Accuracy:** **96.59%**

The script automatically generates and saves the following plots to visualize the model's performance:

2.  **Confusion Matrix:** A heatmap that visualizes where the model made correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

3.  **Classification Metrics:** A bar chart showing the precision, recall, and F1-score for each traffic type.
